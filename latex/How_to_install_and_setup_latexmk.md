# How to install and setup latexmk

# How to install

* it comes with MiKTeX
* you need to install Perl (strawberry?), just google Perl

# How to setup

You need two Files

* A setup file (.latexmkrc)
* A makefile (Makefile)

The setup file will set all the options you warrant. I used a .latexmkrc in
the directory I am using for my files. It looks like this:

```
$pdf_mode = 1;
$pdf_previewer= '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\FoxitReader.exe"  %O %S /A nolock=1';
$silent=0;
$pdflatex = 'lualatex %O %S';
$cleanup_mode=1;
$preview_mode = 1;

```

Pay atention to the nolock command, it took a while to discover it, and it
allows LuaLaTeX (that I use) to overwrite the .pdf files even if they are
open. Clean up didn´t seems to work in my system.

The makefile says the dependency. I was making a presentation to teach
Basic LaTeX, so I used pdfs generated by other .tex files as figures in
my beamer presentation.

The Makefile looked like this:

```
all:	seminario-latex-parte2.pdf  seminario-latex-parte3.pdf seminario-latex-parte1.pdf

seminario-latex-parte3.tex: 	primeiroartigo.pdf 	artigocomabstract.pdf  	labelref.pdf 	minimo.pdf
```

I used the all part because I didn´t want it compiling everything.

Uses:

To compile everything, just type latexmk

To compile one of the 3 parts file, use its name, as in:

latexmk seminario-latex-parte3.tex

There is something that makes empty spaces in the file names a danger.
