# Today I Learneds

Learned about TILs [Simon Willison's](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/), Weblog 
He pointed to [John Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) explainin a TIL:

> A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety
> of languages and technologies. 

He used an automatic README.md generation with a database in other site and some
other confusing stuff. I just process the folders and create the README from til.md.

Check the TIL about Actions in GitHub to learn how I did it.
