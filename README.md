# Today I Learneds

I learned about TILs in [Simon Willison's](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/), Weblog. 
He pointed to [John Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), who explains a TIL:

> A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety
> of languages and technologies. 

He used an automatic README.md generation with a database in other site and some
other rather complex stuff. I just process the folders and create the README from til.md using GitHub Actions.

Check the TIL about Actions in GitHub to learn how I did it.

*Some TILs are in my first language, Portuguese*
